#The Great Noodle Incident: QuickBite's Ordering System Meltdown


*Issue Summary:*
On August 15, 2024, from 18:30 to 20:45 EDT, QuickBite's food ordering system experienced a critical outage. During this period, 93% of our users were unable to place orders, view restaurant menus, or track their deliveries. The root cause was identified as a database connection pool exhaustion triggered by an unexpected surge in traffic due to a viral TikTok challenge involving our platform.

*Timeline:*

	18:30 EDT: Traffic spike detected by automated monitoring systems
	18:32 EDT: On-call engineer received high CPU usage alert
	18:35 EDT: Initial investigation focused on potential DDoS attack
	18:45 EDT: Security team confirmed no signs of malicious activity
	19:00 EDT: Database team noticed unusually high number of open connections
	19:15 EDT: Social media team reported viral TikTok challenge using our app
	19:30 EDT: Issue escalated to senior DevOps team and CTO
	20:00 EDT: Root cause identified as database connection pool exhaustion
	20:30 EDT: Emergency code deployed to increase connection pool size
	20:45 EDT: Systems restored to normal operation

*Root Cause and Resolution:*
The outage was caused by our database connection pool being overwhelmed by a sudden 500% increase in traffic. A viral TikTok challenge encouraged users to rapidly switch between restaurant menus, each switch opening a new database connection. Our connection pool was configured to handle typical peak loads but not this extraordinary surge.
To resolve the issue, we emergency-deployed a configuration change to increase the maximum connection pool size and implemented more aggressive connection recycling. We also added a rate limiter to the menu-switching API to prevent similar issues in the future.

*Corrective and Preventative Measures:*

1-Infrastructure Scaling:
TODO: Implement auto-scaling for database connection pools
TODO: Upgrade database servers to handle 3x current peak load
2-Monitoring and Alerting:
TODO: Add specific alerts for database connection pool usage
TODO: Implement predictive scaling based on real-time social media trend analysis
3-Code Optimization:
TODO: Refactor menu-switching feature to use connection pooling more efficiently
TODO: Implement caching layer for frequently accessed menu items
4-Incident Response:
TODO: Create playbook for handling viral social media-induced traffic spikes
TODO: Conduct monthly "chaos engineering" exercises to simulate extreme load scenarios
5-Communication:
TODO: Improve status page to provide real-time updates during outages
TODO: Develop an automated system for sending apologetic coupons to affected users

*Conclusion:*
While our systems were temporarily overwhelmed by the "Great Noodle Incident" (as we're now calling it), we've learned valuable lessons about the power of social media and the hunger of our users for both food and entertainment. We're implementing changes faster than you can say "one-minute ramen" to ensure QuickBite remains stable, even when the internet decides to make our app the flavor of the week.
Remember, folks: Keep calm and noodle on. We'll handle the rest!
